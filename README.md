## For the Javascript in The Odin Project

Work in progress. Task adding functionality is mostly finished - a summary of the task pops up when a task is hovered over but eventually the tasks will be clickable to expand into a task-view page with ample details.

TODO Project functionality is currently bugging. Clickable project list needs to be added to the side bar.

TODO Styling needs some work. Transitions/fade effects are clunky.
